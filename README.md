# Unexpected Behavior with CSS `calc()`

This repository demonstrates some uncommon errors that can occur when using the CSS `calc()` function.  The `calc()` function is powerful, but requires careful attention to detail. Inconsistent units, incorrect expressions, and unexpected interactions with layout models like flexbox can lead to subtle bugs that are difficult to track down.

The `bug.css` file contains examples of these issues, while `bugSolution.css` provides corrected versions.  The README provides a detailed explanation of each error and its solution.

## Bugs

* **Inconsistent Units:**  Mixing units within a single `calc()` expression (e.g., `calc(100% - 5em + 20px)`) without proper understanding of their relative values can yield unpredictable results.
* **Incorrect Expression:** Typos or incorrect operator precedence in the `calc()` expression can lead to erroneous calculations.
* **Flexbox Interactions:** The use of `calc()` within a flexbox context sometimes produces issues if the parent's size is not fully resolved before the calculation is performed.
* **Data Type Issues:**  The data types in the `calc()` expression should be consistent and appropriate for the calculation being performed. The interaction between units like percentage and pixels can be tricky, and there might be unexpected rounding that can lead to subtle visual discrepancies.

## Solutions

The `bugSolution.css` file addresses these issues by:

* **Ensuring Unit Consistency:** Using the same unit type throughout each `calc()` expression whenever possible. If different units must be mixed, ensure a clear understanding of how those units will interact in the context of the layout.
* **Correcting Expressions:** Double-checking for typos and ensuring correct operator precedence to ensure accurate calculations.
* **Addressing Flexbox Issues:** Using appropriate techniques, such as using `width: fit-content;` or adjusting the order of calculations, to avoid conflicts with the flexbox layout.
* **Managing Data Types:**  Being explicit with units, and when necessary, using variables or functions to simplify the code structure and enhance readability. Avoid overly complex `calc()` expressions.
