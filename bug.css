The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations, but sometimes it can lead to unexpected results if the units are not consistent or if there's a mistake in the calculation expression. For example, using `calc(100% - 10px)` within a flexbox layout might not work as expected if the parent element's width isn't fully determined before the calculation is applied. Also, missing or incorrect spacing in the `calc()` expression can cause errors.  Another issue is the unexpected behavior of `calc()` with different data types, especially mixing percentages and pixels without careful consideration of context.
